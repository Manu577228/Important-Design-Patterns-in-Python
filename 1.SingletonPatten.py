# The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 
# This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

# In Python, you can implement Singleton by overriding the __new__() method or by using decorators/metaclasses. 
# We ensure that the class is instantiated only once â€” further calls return the same object.

    _instance = None
